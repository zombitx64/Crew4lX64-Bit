<summary>🤓 <strong>My Personal Story</strong></summary>

My journey with computers started in childhood when my dad, a computer scientist, introduced me to an Amstrad computer. Those early days sparked a fascination with technology, leading me to pursue computer science and specialize in NLP during my postgraduate studies. It was during this time that I first delved into web crawling, building tools to help researchers organize papers and extract information from publications a challenging yet rewarding experience that honed my skills in data extraction.

Fast forward to 2023, I was working on a tool for a project and needed a crawler to convert a webpage into markdown. While exploring solutions, I found one that claimed to be open-source but required creating an account and generating an API token. Worse, it turned out to be a SaaS model charging $16, and its quality didn’t meet my standards. Frustrated, I realized this was a deeper problem. That frustration turned into turbo anger mode, and I decided to build my own solution. In just a few days, I created Crawl4AI. To my surprise, it went viral, earning thousands of GitHub stars and resonating with a global community.

I made Crawl4AI open-source for two reasons. First, it’s my way of giving back to the open-source community that has supported me throughout my career. Second, I believe data should be accessible to everyone, not locked behind paywalls or monopolized by a few. Open access to data lays the foundation for the democratization of AI, a vision where individuals can train their own models and take ownership of their information. This library is the first step in a larger journey to create the best open-source data extraction and generation tool the world has ever seen, built collaboratively by a passionate community.

Thank you to everyone who has supported this project, used it, and shared feedback. Your encouragement motivates me to dream even bigger. Join us, file issues, submit PRs, or spread the word. Together, we can build a tool that truly empowers people to access their own data and reshape the future of AI.

## Installation 🛠️

Crawl4AI offers flexible installation options to suit various use cases. You can install it as a Python package or use Docker.

<details>
<summary>🐍 <strong>Using pip</strong></summary>

Choose the installation option that best fits your needs:

### Basic Installation

For basic web crawling and scraping tasks:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai
crawl4ai-setup # Setup the browser
```

By default, this will install the asynchronous version of Crawl4AI, using Playwright for web crawling.

👉 **Note**: When you install Crawl4AI, the `crawl4ai-setup` should automatically install and set up Playwright. However, if you encounter any Playwright-related errors, you can manually install it using one of these methods:

1. Through the command line:

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

2. If the above doesn't work, try this more specific command:

   ```bash
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```

This second method has proven to be more reliable in some cases.

---

### Installation with Synchronous Version

The sync version is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. If you need the synchronous version using Selenium:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai[sync]
```

---

### Development Installation

For contributors who plan to modify the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai.git
cd crawl4ai
pip install -e .                    # Basic installation in editable mode
```

Install optional features:

```bash
pip install -e ".[torch]"           # With PyTorch features
pip install -e ".[transformer]"     # With Transformer features
pip install -e ".[cosine]"          # With cosine similarity features
pip install -e ".[sync]"            # With synchronous crawling (Selenium)
pip install -e ".[all]"             # Install all optional features
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🐳 <strong>Docker Deployment</strong></summary>

> 🚀 **Major Changes Coming!** We're developing a completely new Docker implementation that will make deployment even more efficient and seamless. The current Docker setup is being deprecated in favor of this new solution.

### Current Docker Support

The existing Docker implementation is being deprecated and will be replaced soon. If you still need to use Docker with the current version:

- 📚 [Deprecated Docker Setup](./docs/deprecated/docker-deployment.md) - Instructions for the current Docker implementation
- ⚠️ Note: This setup will be replaced in the next major release

### What's Coming Next?

Our new Docker implementation will bring:
- Improved performance and resource efficiency
- Streamlined deployment process
- Better integration with Crawl4AI features
- Enhanced scalability options

Stay connected with our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) for updates!

### Quick Test

Run a quick test (works for both Docker options):

```python
import requests

# Submit a crawl job
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11235/crawl",
    json={"urls": "https://example.com", "priority": 10}
)
task_id = response.json()["task_id"]

# Continue polling until the task is complete (status="completed")
result = requests.get(f"http://localhost:11235/task/{task_id}")
```

## Version Numbering in Crawl4AI

Crawl4AI follows standard Python version numbering conventions (PEP 440) to help users understand the stability and features of each release.

### Version Numbers Explained

Our version numbers follow this pattern: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., 0.4.3)

#### Pre-release Versions
We use different suffixes to indicate development stages:

- `dev` (0.4.3dev1): Development versions, unstable
- `a` (0.4.3a1): Alpha releases, experimental features
- `b` (0.4.3b1): Beta releases, feature complete but needs testing
- `rc` (0.4.3rc1): Release candidates, potential final version

#### Installation
- Regular installation (stable version):
  ```bash
  pip install -U crawl4ai
  ```

- Install pre-release versions:
  ```bash
  pip install crawl4ai --pre
  ```

- Install specific version:
  ```bash
  pip install crawl4ai==0.4.3b1
  ```

#### Why Pre-releases?
We use pre-releases to:
- Test new features in real-world scenarios
- Gather feedback before final releases
- Ensure stability for production users
- Allow early adopters to try new features

For production environments, we recommend using the stable version. For testing new features, you can opt-in to pre-releases using the `--pre` flag.
